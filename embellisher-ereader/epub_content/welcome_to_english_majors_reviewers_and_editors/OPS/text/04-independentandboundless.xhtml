            <h1>Independent &amp; Boundless</h1>
        </header>

        <p>While EMRE focuses on quality and pushing the limits, we are open to independent authors, businesses, creators, and even families.  That's why we describe 
		ourselves as “Your local printshop for the digital age.”  Now, and soon to be in the past, one brings everything from a book to invitations and menus to a printshop.  We believe that anyone can publish anything digitally at EMRE.  Take a look at some of the examples of projects below that we could complete:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Novels</li>
            <li>DIY and instructional books</li>
            <li>Restaurant menus</li>
            <li>Brochures</li>
            <li>Portfolios</li>
            <li>Magazines</li>
            <li>Wedding and family event books/albums</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By styling, embedding multimedia, and adding interactive elements to any of those projects, we can enhance your story, business, and family event and show more of what is left out of a traditional publication.</p>

        <p>For example, a restaurant menu is effective in nearly any form.  But imagine a menu that not only lists the dishes with a simple description but features pop-up definitions for foreign language named dishes, 360º views of 
		scrumptious dishes, and interviews with the owners, chefs, patrons and staff.</p>

        <p>Or take the wedding or family event.  We can take your photography, videography, and memorabilia (dinner menus, styled name tags, etc) and package them together in our universal format for friends and family to enjoy for years to come.  Besides what you already have, we could transcribe your speeches, show locations on interactive maps, and show how a relationship or life was lived on an interactive timeline.</p>

        <p>The possibilities are endless, and we are dedicated to giving these kinds of experiences to anyone who wants to publish them.  We want to cut through the big 5 
		publishers&#39; bureaucracy and provide you with a personalized production to match what you've dreamt up.  EMRE is also dedicated to affordable rates and low-to-no royalties for your publication on our market, if you'd like it sold.</p>

        <p>We can also help you market and network your book and yourself as an author.  We offer a free profile on our marketplace for readers to discover you and your writings.  On top of that, we have the skills to help you develop a stronger web and social media presence.  At EMRE, we love to go a step beyond to give you, as an independent creator, what you need to succeed.</p>
