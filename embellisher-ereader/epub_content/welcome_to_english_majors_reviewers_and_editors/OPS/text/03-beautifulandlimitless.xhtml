            <h1>Beautiful &amp; Limitless</h1>
        </header>

        <p>In this section you will get a chance to see examples of our design and interaction, and some of the process that goes into each book.  Our team is excited to create for an author his or her vision of an eBook and to push the limits of the format.  We have the talent and know-how to create beautiful illustrations, thematic styles, and interactive components, and we love to do it!</p>

        <aside>
            <h2>The format, EPUB3, in a nutshell</h2>
            <p>It is not necessary for anyone and everyone to understand the format we use to create content, that's our job, but it is helpful to know what is possible and what isn't when creating or reading an EPUB3 file.  EPUB3 is great because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is an almost universal format for eReaders, phones, tablets and computers.  It can be read natively, with our reader, on online readers like Readium, or others like iBooks and Kindle.</li>
                <li>The specification for EPUB3 allows for diverse styles and forms of text and images.  Its appearance is nearly as malleable as websites on the internet.</li>
                <li>EPUB3 also features the ability to embed multimedia into a title, such as audio and video as well as images.</li>
                <li>Last but not least, we can script in EPUB3.  That means we can create interactive elements that have been missing in readable media since the beginning.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As exciting as all the positive features are, there are a few drawbacks:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Depending on the devices you want to read or publish to, certain features won't be available. Some of this might be obvious; eInk readers like original Kindles won't be able to play videos, but even readers that seem advanced, might not be able to handle our interactive content.</li>
                <li>Because EPUB3 is so universal, it is often a challenge to get titles to look great on every device. At EMRE, we take time to ensure the product looks good on as many devices as we can get our hands on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Because of the power of EPUB3, and its unfortunate drawbacks, we recommend you use our reader.  While this might sound a little pushy, the truth is that our reader is designed to take full advantage of the format we use and it will display our work and that of our creators, to 100% of its quality and intended vision.</p>

        <h2>Illustrations</h2>

        <p>We are lucky to have at our disposal some incredible illustration talent in Ari Bernabei and Vali Lancea.  Below are some examples of their work; from book covers to architectural images and character development to action scenes, our artists can do whatever you need done.  Click on either collection for a closer look.</p>

        <h2>Design</h2>

        <p>The inspiration of our design is always derived from the content and the creator.  The goal behind design for us is to capture the essence of the story being told or business being described.  In these pages, you can observe how we branded the content and kept the layout clean and easy to read.  In other titles, like <em>Steam City Pirates</em>, we take eBook design into another realm.  Take a look at the example below:</p>

        <div class="steamcitypirates-reader">
            <p >When Poe returned, he held in his hands a paper, which he proceeded to read to me, with no explanation, with no preface, and with no afterward. The words alone were, to him, enough said. These same words came to me later because I had remembered them—all of them—all these years following that day. I had used them on the battlefield, when I thought I would be the next to catch a bullet in the brain, or when I was so alone and frightened before another coming battle that I believed Satan himself was orchestrating my life. I spoke these words into the foggy mist of that dark catacomb:</p>

                Take this kiss upon the brow!<br />
                And, in parting from you now,<br />
                Thus much let me avow-<br />
                You are not wrong, who deem<br />
                That my days have been a dream;<br />
                Yet if hope has flown away<br />
                In a night, or in a day,<br />
                In a vision, or in none,<br />
                Is it therefore the less gone?<br />
                All that we see or seem<br />
                Is but a dream within a dream.<br />
                I stand amid the roar<br />
                Of a surf-tormented shore,<br />
                And I hold within my hand<br />
                Grains of the golden sand-<br />
                How few! yet how they creep<br />
                Through my fingers to the deep,<br />
                While I weep- while I weep!<br />
                O God! can I not grasp<br />
                Them with a tighter clasp?<br />
                O God! can I not save<br />
                One from the pitiless wave?<br />
                Is all that we see or seem<br />
                But a dream within a dream?
            </p>

            <p >After I spoke these words, my mother figure, the dreamer, opened her eyes and stared at me, fixedly, as if I were the one who was now dreaming. “What are you saying? Are you saying these puzzles were all meant for me alone to solve?” I asked.</p>

            <p >The Italian-American ambassador began to dance in circles with her tiny Roman soldier. “Yes! Now you have it, Detective O’Malley! The dreamer creates your difficulties. She is your nemesis. As you attempt to solve the dilemmas we place before you, she will devise another false clue, another dead end, and you must find your way out of her mazes in order to move on to the next level. Don’t you see? Poe was right! Each one of us creates our own reality, yet only those amongst us who are wise enough to find the true source of pain and struggle are allowed to change dimensions and battle for the highest reward of all.”</p>

            <p >“The highest reward? What are you saying?” I could not take my gaze from my mother’s eyes. It was if she alone could allow me to go on playing this puzzle game.</p>

            <p >“The reward is discovering who the Master Dreamer is, of course! He is the one we worship. He is the one who has created all of this we see in the multiverse dimensions. If you can solve the little puzzles leading to the Master Dreamer, you will have approached the Ultimate Science.”</p>

            <p >My mind watched her through my eyes, and as she, my dreamer, my dead mother, began to close her eyes, my eyes also began to close. Slowly, drip by drip, sin by sin, desire by desire, I became unconscious to this reality.</p>

        <h2>Interaction</h2>

        <p>You might be tempted to press that play button featured in the above example, and we made it that way because you can!  Given your reader has the ability to read EPUB3 and has interactive multimedia abilities, you can play back audio and video in a way that doesn't pull the reader out of the experience, but sends them deeper inside.</p>

        <p>We are always interested in what is next around the corner, and to us, sometimes that even means taking a page out of the past.  Below is an example from Jim Musgrave's new title <em>Forevermore</em>.  In the title, we go back to the old “choose your adventure” idea, but put the enhanced eBook twist on it:</p>

        <div class="forevermore-reader">
            <div id="scenario-1"><p>Hello, Dear Reader.  Once again you can make a choice about the direction Detective O’Malley will go.  <a href="#scenario-1-a">Does he return to Walter McKenzie</a> or <a href="#scenario-1-b">to the pub to gather his thoughts?</a> Or?</p></div>

            <img class="section-marker" src="../assets/images/forevermore/section-break.png" />

            <div id="scenario-1-a">
                <p>I left Miss Charming’s apartment and began my walk past the theaters, thinking to find a cab to take me home. Lost in my ponderings, I knew I’d have to get with McKenzie if I was going to get information about the underbelly of this city and the grimier facts regarding the movements of society’s upstanding gentlemen. As I wandered on, lost in my thoughts, I felt someone’s arm encircle mine. Pressing against my side, the woman said, “I might have some information that will interest you.”
                </p>

                <p>I turned to see a young woman with dark straight hair, most of it coiled about her head in a most fetching way, a few tendrils brushing her cheeks in the slight evening breeze. Her dark blue eyes gazed into mine with a twinkling mirth as she waited for my reply. Except for that humorous touch, she was Becky’s opposite in every way.</p>

                <p>“Don’t worry, I saw you come out of the high rise, I was just saying goodbye to my client.  I have a place not far from here; you see Becky sometimes sends me on errands for her. She wanted me to tell you what I know about the little tobacco girl.”</p>

                <p>“You knew Mary?” I asked, feeling a strong doubt rise up over anything she might say, but intrigued to hear any possibilities that might open up this case, even if they were half-truths… or worse.</p>

                <img class="section-marker" src="../assets/images/forevermore/section-break.png" />

                <p><a href="#scenario-2">Read on</a></p>
            </div>

            <div id="scenario-1-b">
                <p>I felt driven to drink, beer or stronger, I didn’t care at that point.  Black cats and crazies everywhere I turned, gangsters and drunks; they seemed to know where I was going or wanted to go. What’s happening to me? Is there even an answer to this mystery? Here’s another direction for you to follow.</p>

                <p>Instead of my drink, I got a slug to the side of my head and shoved into the alley behind The Sons of Liberty tavern. A bunch of toughs smelling like river bilge dragged me outta the booth and “escorted” me out the back door with someone’s calloused hand over my mouth. I resisted as best I could but to no avail. Not a single customer or even the bartender seemed to notice, not unlike the days a hundred years ago when the tavern first started; whoever had the political clout had the physical clout as well.  Thrown up against the wall, some hooligan pinned down my arms while the other wharf rats circled in close.</p>
                
                <p>“So you like to cause trouble do ya, O’Malley? Well our boss don’t like it, see, so we’re here to educate ya. Nobody gives a damn about some lousy dead poet, but lay off that ceegar girl murder. Ain’t none of your business and nobody wants you nosin’ around about it. Get it?”</p>
                
                <p>“Yes,” I replied. “You’ve made the situation simply plain.”</p>
                
                <p>“What’dya mean by that?” one of the ruffians yelled, drawing back his fist to land another good one in my face.</p>
                
                <p>“I mean you’ve made things very clear and there won’t be any trouble.”</p>
                
                <p>“Damn right there won’t be. That’s the way of it and don’t think otherwise. We know what’s goin’ on in this town all the time, so you better stay to clear, O’Malley.”</p>
                
                <p>“We don’t care if you are some damn war hero.  We knows all about yers, so keep your Irish ass out of our territory, see,” one of the louts said.</p>

                <p>The man with the doubled-up fist let go into my solar plexus, and I slumped to the ground as they all rushed out into the dark. But not before I saw the glint of a cargo hook.</p>

        <p>These are but a small example of what we want to accomplish at EMRE.  We have thought up interactive elements such as 3D maps to help describe a setting, mini-games embedded and directed to the style of the book, specifically selected and position triggered background music, and so many more.  And our imagination has only just started up!</p>
