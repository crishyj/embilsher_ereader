        <p>As the owner and “Grand Pooh-Bah” of EMRE Publishing, it’s my voice introducing you to the team and our services.  Jim Musgrave is the name, and indie writing and publishing’s my game!</p>

        <p>Back in 1996, I wrote a book that included a CD tucked neatly in the back of the internationally-distributed trade paperback.  This was a real sticking point for the publisher, Harcourt-Brace, because it was costly.  I finally won the battle; however, I lost the war because, despite a decent advance of $7,500, I never saw a penny of royalties hit my bank account.  This was the era before Amazon made players of all indie publishers, but I was still one very angry author.  This one event led me into the world of independent publishing, and I am your host today because of my positive experiences here.</p>
        
        <p>My street credits as an indie author and creator can be summed up to this moment as being a <a href="http://emrepublishing.com/Forevermore/forevermore-wins-first-in-category-honors-at-chanticleers-international-clue-best-mystery-suspense-and-thriller-competition/">First Place Winner</a> in the international Chanticleer Book Awards for the Historical Mystery category.  My novel, <em>Forevermore</em>, the first in the best-selling series starring Detective Pat O’Malley, also placed as a Finalist in the Next Generation Indie Awards.  In addition, awards are still being determined for other contests, so I may be fortunate enough to win more.</p>

        <p>I have also pushed my hero Detective Pat O’Malley into the world of multimedia steampunk.  You can <a href="http://emrepublishing.com/steam-city-pirates/sample/index.html">view a sample</a> of this fourth book in the bestselling series and see an excellent way to enhance your own work.</p>

        <p>Another book of mine, a little novella called <em>Love Zombies of San Diego</em>, was a <a href="http://emrepublishing.com/Forevermore/love-zombies-of-san-diego-is-finalist-in-san-diego-book-awards/">Finalist</a> in the San Diego Book Awards.  As of this moment (June 16, 2014), I am waiting to go to the awards with my lovely wife, Ellen, to find out if my book won.</p>

        <p>These moments are what we in the creator business wait for all our lives.  They make us proud to be independent and proud to spend all those hours creating what we do.</p>

        <p>We at EMRE Publishing want to help you embellish what you create.  Whether you’re a writer, visual artist, professional business person, or just a family person who wants to do something with those great shots you took at the family reunion, we are here to assist you to create the best look possible.</p>

        <p>Take a look at <a href="http://emrepublishing.com/embellishment_ideas.php">these ideas</a> developed while working with our clients.  We spend the time necessary to develop the <em>best possible display</em> for you, just as this enhanced eBook was developed in order to demonstrate what a simple enhanced eBook looks like. As your tour guide, I will describe the action taking place on your screen.</p>

        <p>Each team member is a dedicated professional in his or her own right, and you will see what he or she can do for you as we navigate through the demonstration.</p>

        <p>Our team will make certain your goals and objectives are clearly understood and that you, in turn, are satisfied with what EMRE will create for you.  All work is guaranteed and no work is undertaken until you and EMRE have agreed regarding your goals and expectations.</p>

        <p>In addition, I am writing a book aimed at the Do-it-Yourself Creator—<em>Running with the Big Dogs:  A Creator’s Guide to Using Electronic Media</em>—with samples from our direct experiences on-the-job with our clients.  You can <a href="http://emrepublishing.com/media/Running%20with%20the%20Big%20Dogs.pdf">see a sample</a> of the first six chapters right now.  You can also hear a <a href="http://emrepublishing.com/Forevermore/inside-scoop-interviews-jim-musgrave-about-enhanced-ebooks/">recent interview</a> regarding enhanced eBooks and my own writing.  In addition, links to interviews in the apps can be provided as they are developed for you, along with just about any promotion you have.</p>
