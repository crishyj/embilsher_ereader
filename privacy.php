                Like most website operators, English Majors collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
                visitor request. English Majors purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how English Majors visitors use its website. From time to time, English Majors may release non-personally-identifying
